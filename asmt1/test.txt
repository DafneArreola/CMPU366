Gov. Andrew P. Stone announced today that the state would expand its scholarship program. 
The plan, first proposed by Sen. Maria L. Cruz, is expected to benefit more than 10,000 students. 
Classes will begin at 10:30 a.m. sharp. 
"Education is our future," Dr. H. J. Lee said. 
St. Louis schools, he noted, have already adopted a similar policy. 
At 3.14 percent, the projected cost increase is modest; (2) experts predict savings elsewhere. 
The U.S. President called it "a landmark decision." 
However, Prof. C. H. Adams cautioned: "Numbers alone do not tell the story." 
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson agreed. 
In fact, their son Robert F. Johnson said, "I believe this will help families like ours."
